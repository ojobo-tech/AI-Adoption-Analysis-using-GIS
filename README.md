# AI-Adoption-Analysis-using-GIS
Analysis of AI Adoption in Developing countries using GIS

# Project Aim
The aim of this project is to ascertain how ready governments in developing nations are to implement AI in the delivery of public service to their citizens, with a focus on certain factors.
Answering this question means measuring the multiple dimension of governmental and technological progress that contribute to AI readiness.

# Code Description
Data Loading and Preprocessing: CSV and Shape Files are loaded, combined, and cleaned. This includes handling missing values, normalization, and encoding categorical features.
Data Visualization

# Project Findings
1. There is a strong relationship between R&D Spending and Adoption of Emerging Technology. Which shows that a country spending in Research and Development shows their willingness to adopt emerging technology.
2. There is not much relationship between the number of Graduates in STEM and a country's Number of AI citable documents. That means even if a country has more graduate students interested from STEM, it doesn't mean they will go on to do research in A.I.
3. There is negligible relationship between the number of Graduates in STEM and a country's Foundational I.T Infrastructure. One would think that if a country has Foundational I.T Infrastructure, more students would go into STEM.
4. Poverty (<$2.60 daily income) shows a negative correlation with all other factors. In other words, when the other variables (Foundational IT Infrastructure, Adoption of Emerging Technologies, etc) improves, a countries poverty level decreases.
5. We found it interesting that overall, there was an upward trend, showing a positive relationship in Governments Responsiveness to change and their Adoption of Emerging Technology.
6. Also, there wasn't an obvious pattern showing a country's Foundational I.T Infrastructure and Adoption of Emerging Technology
7. Overall, countries in Africa showed a government responsiveness to change of less than 50, which also reflected in their Adoption of Emerging Technology, as symbolised by the cluster of circle shapes.
8. Mauritania appeared to be an outlier, showing very low government responsiveness despite average adoption of Emerging Technologies etc.
9. We can see a downward trend, showing that generally, the higher a countries government responsiveness to change, the lower their poverty rate. Which leads us to believe that as a country adopts change in factors like policy, technology and human development, their poverty rate will reduce.
10. The map shows a high poverty rate in countries around Africa, compared to the Asian and Middle Eastern Areas.
11. Although countries like Mongolia in Asia and Saudi Arabia in the Middle East have good Foundational I.T Infrastructure, it doesn't reflect in the number of Graduates in STEM.
12. Compared to other regions, countries in Africa have poor IT infrastructure which also reflects in their number of Graduates from STEM programs.
13. Overall, countries in Africa have low numbers of Citable papers on A.I (less than 1000), compared to countries in other regions, which points to the fact that overall, research in AI is low in Africa. However, India has as many as 23,000 Citable papers on AI, which is reflective of the population.
14. Even countries in war torn regions in the Middle East are researching about AI.
15. Most countries in Africa have government with low responsiveness to change also have a low AI readiness index.

# RECOMMENDATIONS

These recommendations are country and region specific which can be effected in future work. Governments should consider the following:
1. Strengthen STEM Education: Invest in STEM education to cultivate a skilled workforce, vital for driving AI initiatives and fostering innovation in governance.Including incentivizing students going into STEM (scholarships, increased job certainty for STEM profesionals)
2. Government-Industry Collaboration: Governments should foster collaboration between government and private industry for capacity building through workshops, training, and partnerships, enhancing officials' technological understanding.
3. Strategic IT Infrastructure: Prioritize foundational IT infrastructure development, including secure data storage and high-speed internet, to provide a robust backbone for successful AI implementation.
4. Incentives for Innovation: Government should introduce incentives such as funding and tax benefits to stimulate AI innovation, encouraging public-private collaboration to address specific governance challenges effectively.
5. Proactive Change Management: Government should implement proactive change management strategies, including training programs and communication channels, to enhance government responsiveness, fostering a culture of adaptability and innovation.

The countries with the highest poverty rate (South Sudan and Central Africa Republic, represented by the yellow colour) are reflective of the areas where many wars have happened over the last decade.
